\begin{resume}
 
\section{PROFILE} My background in computers from early on led to me pursuing a degree in Computer Science, and my continued interest in learning resulted in continuing on for my Graduate degree.  Working with distributed systems on diverse datasets throughout my work and education history prepared me for my present position with the USGS Office of Water Information, where I work as part on the data science team to implement scientific applications for environmental data.
